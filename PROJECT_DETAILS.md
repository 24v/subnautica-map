# Project Details

**Purpose**: This file contains comprehensive project information filled out by the user and AI collaboratively as the project evolves. It serves as the single source of truth for project setup, technology choices, architecture, and development workflows.

**Instructions**: Fill out the initial sections below. The AI will update and expand this file during bootstrap and ongoing development.


## Project Overview

**Project Name**: 
Subnautica Map

**Short Description**: 
Mapping for subnautica that maintains flavor of the game

**Detailed Description**: 
Instead of creating or adding a map with lines, or using a typical map with fog of war that is revealed during exploration, this one will be based around the user entering coordinates. 

As the player is playing the game, they will discover or create notable places. For example the name and locations of wrecks, resources, buoy, points of interest, changes in biome, caves etc. We call these Points of Interest (POI)

Subnautica does not have a coordinate system visible to the user. Instead it only has references to other artifacts based on distance. Everything will be based on the players starting location (lifeboat 5).

The user will add POI's to this tool, and we will make a visual 2d graph of them, which will be a map the user can reference.

Adding a new POI:
- The user will select one or more of the existing POIs
- They will specify the distance from or to the selected POI
- They will specify the bearing to the selected POI from or to the current position
- They will specify the name of the POI
- They will specify the type of the POI
- They will specify any additional notes

Then the system will:
- Record that information
- Use the bearings to generate a coordinate for the POI using an internal coordinate system based around lifeboat 5.
- It will use the x,y coordinates for graphing the POIs for the user

Coordinate system:
- The user will NEVER tell the system the x,y coordinates (except in a debug mode). Those must be calculated from bearings.

Translation from bearings to coordinates:
- There are multiple bearings from one point to other, and those to others. Not all bearings to all points by the user will need to be entered.
- The system will remember the original bearing information that the user enters.
- The user can enter multiple bearings for each new POI, and can add addtional bearings to existing POIs.
- The system will need translate the bearings into coordinates. It will serialize the coordinates.
- The bearing entries are not exact and will definitely diverge
- The system will translate bearing and coorinates for each POI trying to minimize the errors between all the bearings and the coordinates.
- When a new POI is entered, the system will try to optimize the coordinates for JUST THAT POI.
- There will be an additional function the user can choose to re-calculate coordinates for ALL

**POI Types:**
- üö¢ Wrecks (Aurora sections, other crashed ships)
- üè≠ Structures (Bases, Degasi habitats, Precursor facilities)  
- üåä Biome Boundaries (Safe Shallows, Kelp Forest, Dunes, etc.)
- üíé Resource Nodes (Metal salvage, limestone, sandstone outcrops)
- üï≥Ô∏è Cave Entrances (Lost River, Lava Zone access points)
- üéØ Landmarks (Floating Island, Mountain Island, Aurora)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hazards (Reaper spawns, dangerous areas)
- üîß Player Bases (Custom built structures)
- üìç Buoy (Custom navigation markers)

**User Stories**:

**As a Subnautica player, I want to:**

1. Create new POIs
- Specify reference POIs and the bearings and distance to those POI's
- Specify the depth
- Specify the type of POI
- Specify the name of the POI
- The system will record the new POI as well as calculating its coordinates from the bearing(s)

2. View POI's on a graph
- Based on a coordinate system around lifeboat 5
- Different images based on types (we can use emojis for now)

3. View and Edit existing POI details
- View and edit the fields of the POI.

4. Explicitly choose to re-calculate all coordinates for POI's based on ALL recorded bearings. Trying to minimize error / conflicts.

5. Zoom in and out in graph to get context

6. See previous maps, that have persisted across browser refreshes.
Have the ability to save or work on mulitiple different maps

7. Import / Export the coordinates to a file which can then be imported as a new map

8. Feel immersed in the game with UI that fits aesthetic

## Template & Policy Overrides

### Template Overrides
- **Component Templates**: Focus on immersive, game-themed UI components with dark ocean aesthetics
- **Form Templates**: Specialized coordinate input forms with bearing validation and visual feedback
- **Canvas Templates**: 2D map rendering components with zoom, pan, and POI overlay capabilities
- **Audio Templates**: Atmospheric audio management with ambient ocean sounds and UI feedback

### Technology Preference Overrides
- **Canvas Library**: Use Konva.js instead of vanilla Canvas API for better React integration and performance
- **Audio Library**: Use Howler.js for cross-browser audio compatibility and spatial audio features
- **Math Library**: Include Lodash for coordinate calculation utilities and data manipulation
- **Styling**: Emphasize dark, oceanic color schemes with bioluminescent accents to match Subnautica aesthetic
- **State Management**: Client-side only with Local Storage persistence (no external databases)

### Testing Policy Overrides
- **Algorithm Testing**: Extensive unit tests for triangulation algorithms and coordinate calculations
- **Canvas Testing**: Mock Konva components for rendering tests without actual canvas rendering
- **Audio Testing**: Mock Howler.js for audio functionality without actual sound playback
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive testing of bearing input validation and coordinate format handling
- **Local Storage**: Test data persistence and retrieval scenarios
