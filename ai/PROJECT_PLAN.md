## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- [ ] 1) Build an immersive UI that maintains Subnautica's atmospheric feel
- [ ] 2) Create a bearing-based coordinate system for POI mapping
- [ ] 3) Implement triangulation algorithms for coordinate calculation from bearings
- [ ] 4) Implement local data persistence for POI storage

// Unscoped - [ ] : Add atmospheric audio integration matching game ambiance
